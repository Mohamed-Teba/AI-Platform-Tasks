Welcome to the **AI Platform Tasks** repository! This project is a collection of hands-on Jupyter notebooks designed to explore fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks using PyTorch. Each task builds practical skills through code implementations, visualizations, and experiments. Whether you're a beginner or brushing up on DL basics, dive in! 🚀

## 📋 Overview
This repo contains a series of progressive tasks:
- **Task 01**: Building a custom neural network with forward/backward passes (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh activations).
- **Task 02**: [Add description if available, e.g., "Data loading and simple training loop"].
- **Task 03**: [Add description, e.g., "Convolutional layers for image processing"].
- ... (and more as you add notebooks!)

Focus areas include:
- Neural network architectures 🏗️
- Activation functions and gradients 🔄
- Optimization and loss functions 📈
- Data handling with PyTorch datasets 📊
- Model evaluation and visualization 📊

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Teba/AI-Platform-Tasks.git
   cd AI-Platform-Tasks
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📖 Usage
Run individual tasks or explore the entire series! 📓

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open a task notebook.
3. Experiment: Tweak parameters, add plots, or extend models to see changes in real-time.
